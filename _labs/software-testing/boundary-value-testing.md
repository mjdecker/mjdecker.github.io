# Discussion
* Using CMake
* std::initializer_list

# Lab Grading Policy
* Labs are worth 10 points
	* 6 points for attending
	* 4 points for completing 
* Labs are due before the following Friday

# Clone Lab
* Accept lab from URL on Canvas
* Clone repository

# CMake
* Build system generator
* Encode project build info in `CMakeLists.txt` file
* Generate build using `cmake`

# Example CMakeLists.txt

* `std::initializer_list<T>`  - a lightweight proxy object that provides access to an array of objects of type const T
* Used to allow other objects to use array initialization syntax (i.e,`{ }`)

# Test Set ADT
1. Lab repo contains code for a Set ADT
2. This Set only works for integers in the range of [0-7]. Internally, an array of booleans is used to indicate integer membership, where a true at position `i` in the array denotes that the integer `i` is in the set.
3. Test each of the following using boundary-value testing:
	1. `set(std::initializer_list<int> a)` - specify values in set e.g., `{1, 4, 7}`
	2. `operator[](int num)` - check if `num` is in set
	3. `operator+(set a, set b)` - perform set union of `a` and `b` 

# Example `set(std::initializer_list<int> a)` Test
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mjdecker/fada6c1f03badcb9d874025b149767ad.js?file=test_initializer_list.cpp"></script>

# Example `operator[](int num)` Test
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mjdecker/fada6c1f03badcb9d874025b149767ad.js?file=test_subscript.cpp"></script>

# Example `operator+(set a, set b)` Test
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mjdecker/fada6c1f03badcb9d874025b149767ad.js?file=test_union.cpp"></script>

# Completion Requirements
* You have correctly applied boundary-value testing for each of the three constructors/methods
* Each is tested in its own file
* You have committed and pushed all code to GitHub
