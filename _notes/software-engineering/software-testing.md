# What is Software Testing?
* The objective is to find faults
* A fault is incorrect output for a given input
* Faults are caused by errors in your program  
* An error (bug) is an incorrect peace of code
	* Missing condition
	* Incorrect stopping condition
`

# How to find the Faults?
* Test cases are developed to exercise your program with the goal of finding errors
	* This will lead you to fault(s) in the code
* The best test case is one that has a high probability to cause an error
* Start by testing each method (unit tests)
* Then each class in full (module tests)
* Then the whole program (system tests)
`

# Information Needed
* A method/function is defined by an input/output specification (I/O spec).
	* The pre and post conditions describe the I/O spec
* A method/function is also defined by its implementation details
	* For-loop vs while loop vs recursive
`

# Black vs White Box
* Black box testing uses only the I/O spec to develop test cases
* White box uses only the implementation details to develop test cases
* Both types of information are necessary to develop a good set of test cases for a method/function
`

# Number of Test Cases?
* Most functions have a very large (i.e., infinite) number of possible inputs and outputs
* Do you need to test all of these to be satisfied your function behaves correctly?  NO!
* Again, the best test case is one that has a high probability in uncovering a fault
`

# Pairing Down Test Cases
* Can take advantage of symmetries, equivalencies, and interdependencies in the data to reduce the number of test cases.
	* Equivalence Testing
	* Boundary Value Analysis
* Determine the ranges of input & output
* Develop equivalence classes of input/output
* Examine the boundaries of these classes carefully
`

# Equivalence Partitioning
* Input data and output results often fall into sets of related data called equivalence partitions
	* Given the range -20, ... 20
	* One partition: {-20, ... , -1}, {0}, {1, ... 20}
* Test cases should be chosen from each of the different partition
	* -10, 0, 10
`

# Boundary Value Analysis
* Given the equivalence partitions:
	* {-20, ... , -1}, {0}, {1, ... 20}
* Choose test cases at the boundary of these â€¨sets:
	* -20, -1, 0, 1, 20
`

# Example
* Problem: Search an array Tbl of size N for a key K, Return the location of first occurrence 
* Equivalence Partitions:
* N: {0, ..., MAX}
* K: {-maxint, ..., maxint}
* Tbl: contains K, does not contain K
* Tbl: K at 0 ... N
* Tbl: contains multiple K
`

# Test Cases
* One from each equivalence and the boundaries
* N: 0, 1, MAX/2, MAX-1, MAX
* K: -10, 0, 10
* Tbl: K at 0, 1, MAX/2, MAX-1, MAX
* Tbl: K not in the array
* Tbl: Multiple K in the array
`

# Unit Testing
* Build a program (called a driver) for unit testing
* One test driver (main) for each method
* Test simplest methods first, more complex later
* Test constructors, I/O, simple accessors, then more complex operations
`

# Test-Driven Development
0. Determine the I/O Spec
1. Write the simplest test case you can that fails (Red Phase)
	* Run test-suite to make sure fails
2. Implement only the code you need for case to pass (Green Phase)
	* Run test-suite to ensure passes
3. Refactor the code
4. Repeat until Object under Test 	is fully completely implemented
`

# Regression Testing
* Each time you add a new method to your class or fix a fault, run ALL your test cases 
* Adding something new or fixing a problem may have side effects
* Re-running your test cases will help to uncover these problems (if they happen)
