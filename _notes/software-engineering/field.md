# Processes Needed
* Fix bugs quickly and safely
* Introduce new features quickly and safely
* Get users what they need
* Stay current with changes in software environment

# Quality Focus & Process
* Goals (Quality Focus)
	* Foundation of software engineering
	* Software should meet expectations
	* What level/kinds of quality do you require?
		* Customer: efficiency, reliability, etc.
		* Developer: maintainability, reusability, etc.
		* Users: usability, efficiency, etc.
	* Microsoft Word vs. Autonomous Car
* Process
	* Framework for how you develop/deliver software on time and on budget
	* Defines tasks and order performed
	* How you achieve quality focus

# Methods & Tools
* Methods
	* Techniques for performing tasks of the process
	* Multiple techniques to accomplish same task

* Tools
	* What is used to carry out/support methods

# Stakeholders, e.g., People
* Developers
* Developers' management
* Other parts of the company
* Users
* Osers' management
* Other parts of the users' company
* Others in same industry
* Reviewers and the outside world
