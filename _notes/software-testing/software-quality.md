# Testing & Quality Assurance
* Software Quality Assurance (SQA) [IEEE Std 730-2014]
	* Activities that define and assess the adequacy of software processes for producing software products of suitable quality for their intended purposes
* Encompasses and Includes
	* *Verification* & *Validation*
	* Audits & Reviews

# Verification vs. Validation
* **Verification:** The software should conform to its specification 
	* Are we building the product right?
* **Validation:** The software should do what the user really requires
	* Are we building the right product?

# Dynamic vs. Static Verification
* Dynamic - Exercising and observing product behavior
	* Software Testing
* Static - Concerned with analysis of static representation to discover problems
	* Code Analysis
	* Pair programming, inspections, and walk-throughs
	* Highly effective tool for defect detection

# V & V Planning
* Careful planning is required to get the most out of testing and inspection processes
* Planning should start early in the development process
* Test planning is about defining standards for the testing process rather than describing product tests
* The plan should identify the balance between static verification and testing

# A Software Test Plan
* The testing process
* Requirements traceability
* Tested items
* Testing schedule
* Test recording procedures
* Hardware and software requirements
* Constraints
