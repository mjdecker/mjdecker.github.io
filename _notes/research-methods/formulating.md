# Formulating a Research Problem
* Forms a basis for everything else:
	* Feasibility
	* What is investigated
	* How it is investigated
	* Methodology used
* The more flushed out, the clearer and easier the remaining steps

# Sources of Research Problems
* Investigate the field/discipline
* Look at future work
* Look toward:
	* Population - study population consisting of single instances/individuals, groups, etc.
	* Problems - issue, need, deficiency, attitudes, or some other problem
	* Programs - structure, service provided, consumer satisfaction, effectiveness of an intervention, etc.
	* Phenomena - cause and effect, relationships, the phenomena itself, etc.

# Considerations
* Interest & Relevancy
	* To you
	* To research community
	* To stakeholders
* Magnitude/Scale
* Measurability
* Level of Expertise
* Data Availability
* Ethical issues

# Possible Steps
1. Identify main area
2. Break into smaller topics
3. Select topic of most interest
4. Propose research questions
5. Formulate objectives
6. Assess objectives in terms of research success
7. Re-check your formulation

# A Dissection (incomplete) of Software Engineering
* Software Engineering
	* Program Comprehension
		* Summarization
			* Class Summarization
			* Method Summarization
				* Parameter Summarization
	* Empirical Software Engineering
	* Testing
	* Etc.

# Formulate Research Objective
* Main objective - what is the main goal of the study
* Sub-objectives - more specific components of the main objective
* Main objective - See if a benefit to using camelCase vs under_score
* Sub objectives
	* Is it easier/faster to locate one vs the other?
	* Do variables of one type have greater recall accuracy?
	* Quicker recall?
	* Does one identifier style have a better affect on maintenance activities?

# Determine Study Population
* Who/what is the study population?
* Must be appropriate for objective/research question
* Are there constraints on the population?
	* Availability
	* Resources (including time) 

# Determine Operational Definitions
* Objectives or terms can be at a high-level or differ from person to person
* Define terms related to study so that they are unambiguous and measurable
* Avoid confusing and reusing of terms for separate concepts
* Clarity will aid in study design, obtaining valid results, and audience (readers) to understand the work

# Qualitative
* Previous process is mostly for quantitive aspects
* Quantitative is specific and more narrowly focused
* Qualitative is flexible to reformulation at later times
	* May still want to make sure certain topics are included
