# Study Design
* Study design differs depending on Qualitative/Quantitative
* Quantitative
	* Specific, rigid, well-structured
	* Ensure validity and reliability
* Qualitative
	* Flexible, emergent, non-sequential
* Differences in paradigm and study aims determine enquiry approach

# Quantitative Research
* Can view according to the following three perspectives (general science)
	* Number of contacts with study population
	* Reference Period
	* Nature of investigation

# Number of Contacts
* Cross-section (most common) - take a cross-section of the population at one point in time
* Before-and-after - AKA pre-test/post-test design where two cross-sectional data points are collected from same population to ascertain changes
* Longitudinal - population is researched a number of times via a series of cross-sectional studies collecting same information 


# Reference Period
* Retrospective - investigate things that happened in the past
* Prospective - investigate things that are likely to happen in the future
* Retrospective-prospective - focus on both past trends and study into the future, e.g., before-and-after study without a control group

# When you have historical records (aside)
* E.g., Repository (MSR)
* Learn/analyze past history data and see if holds for future (but still past) occurrences

# Nature of Investigation
* Experimental - starting from the cause to establish the effect; the researcher introduces the intervention that is assumed to cause the change in a controlled or natural environment
* Non-experimental - starting with the effect to research the cause; a phenomenon is known and the researcher attempts to establish what caused it
* Quasi- or semi-experimental - has elements of both experimental and non-experimental studies

# Experimental Designs
* After-only - element of study currently or previously exposed to some intervention and baseline data exists (can be recall of respondents).  Dependent on ability to construct accurate baseline.
* Before-and-after - Establish baseline before intervention and observe affect after it has taken affect
* Control group - consist of experimental group receiving intervention and control group (not receiving intervention) but the same otherwise.  Measure before and after results.
* Double control group - Same as control group, except a second control group for which you do not measure before observation in order to control for possible research tool affects

# Experimental Designs (continued)
* Comparative design - Population is split into different groups and different treatments applied to each group.  Each group evaluated according to some baseline of the dependent variable
* Matched control - Control group like experiment where comparability determined on a individual-by-individual basis.  E.g., two individuals who are identical in respect to criteria relevant to study are split into the separate groups  
* Placebo design - Two to three groups.  One group receives treatment, one group receives a fake treatment (placebo), and control group (optional)

# Other Quantitative Designs
* Survey - E.g., online survey via Qualtrics
* Cross-over comparative - Control group where after a certain time period (or periods) the control group and experimental group are swapped
* Replicated cross-sectional - Intervention may already be in existence.  Use subject at various points of having received said intervention.

# Other Quantitative Designs (continued)
* Trend studies - multiple cross-sectional observations are made through past/presence and into the future to find a pattern of change
* Cohort studies - study (utilizing another design) on a population with a particular characteristic
* Panel studies - longitudinal, prospective, and data always collected from same subjects
* Blind study - in comparative/placebo the subject do not know what group they are assigned to
* double-blind studies - blind with researcher also not knowing who is part of what group

# Some Additional CS Related Designs
* Empirical studies
* Formal Proof
* Mathematical Modeling
* Simulation
* Performance metrics

# Qualitative Research
* Case studies - in-depth exploration of a typical case of a particular event, group, instance, etc.
* Oral history - obtaining, recording, presenting and interpreting information in someone’s own words
* Focus groups/group interviews - facilitated group interviews of an open discussion of a topic

# Qualitative Research (continued)
* Participant observation - researcher gets involved in a social interaction and observes the situation first hand
* Holistic research - more a philosophy, research from every perspective
* Community discussion forums - large group discussion
* Reflective journal log - diary of the researcher’s thoughts

# Philosophy Guided Designs
* Action Research - Research that requires action to improve practice or take action to an issue
* Feminist research - Underpinned by feminist concerns in terms social inequality between men and women
* Participatory and collaborative research enquiry - Based on the philosophy of community development involving community members actively in the research process

# Remarks
* There are numerous study designs
* Separate fields (in CS and others) employ different designs for different problems
* Reviewing the literature on a subject will demonstrate what is acceptable for a related problem

# In-class
* Research Problem: Many students have difficulty in learning computer science.  This is indicted by an above average failure/repeat rate. 
* Research Questions: What are the difficulties students have in computer science courses?
*  Split into four groups, each group will be assigned one of the following study designs:
	* Experiment
	* Survey
	* Focus group
	* Participant observation

# In-class (continued)
* Report back the following:
	* Study population
	* Number of contacts with the study population
	* Reference period of the study
	* Procedure of data collection
	* Ethical issues
	* Advantages of the study design
	* Disadvantages of the study design
