# Research Process
* > Although the basic logic scientific methodology is the same in all fields, its specific techniques and approaches will vary, depending upon the subject matter [Festinger and Katz 1966]
* Research is performed similarly throughout disciplines
* Same process used for qualitative and quantitative research
* Differ in methods of data collection, data processing, analyzing, reporting, and disseminating 

# Scientific Method
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#Process)
* Steps
	* Formulate a question
	* Form a hypothesis
	* Make a prediction
	* Conduct an experiment
	* Analyze results
* Steps are guidelines
	* All steps are not always needed
	* Order can vary
* Compare with [Elements of Scientific Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#Elements_of_the_scientific_method)

# Kumar's Phases & Steps
* Can be broken down into 3 phases and 8 steps
* Phase I: Deciding what to research
	* Step I: Formulating a research problem
* Phase II: Planning a research study
	* Step II: Conceptualizing a research design
	* Step III: Constructing an instrument for data collection
	* Step IV: Selecting a sample
	* Step V: Writing a research proposal
* Phase III: Conducting a research study
	* Step VI: Collecting data
	* Step VII: Processing and displaying data
	* Step VIII: Writing a research report

# Phase I: Deciding - Step 1
**Formulating a research problem**

* What do I want to investigate?
	* Enough funds?
	* Sufficient time?
		* Aiming for particular conference deadline
		* Can it be computed in a reasonable time frame?
	* Enough knowledge/skills?
* Literature review
* Most important step
* Basis for all following steps

# Phase II: Planning - Step II
**Conceptualizing a research design**

* Findings depend on the design of the research study
* Will you use qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods?
* Form design so:
	* Valid and verifiable
	* Feasible
* Know the shortcomings and strengths of the chosen design

# Occam' Razor
> Do not multiple except out of necessity

* AKA KISS Principle
* Good advice in research design (and probably everything else)
	* Easier to design
	* Easier to test
	* Easier to verify
	* Reduce chance of error
* [Leprechan Example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor#Justifications)
* [Occam's Razor & the Scientific Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor#Science_and_the_scientific_method)

# Phase II: Planning - Step III
**Constructing an instrument for data collection**

* Do you already have access to data?
* If not, what means will you use to collect the data?
* Involves construct a research instrument or research tool
	* E.g., Interview schedule, survey, software, etc.
* Valuable to pre-test tool in pilot study to identify areas of improvement

# Phase II: Planning - Step IV
**Selecting a sample**
* Selection of who/what the study will be performed on
* Avoid bias in subject selection
* Sample/participants need to be representative and appropriate to study
* Will samples be taken at random or not and why?
* Know strengths weaknesses of selection technique
* Justify selection 

# Phase II: Planning - Step V
**Writing a research proposal**

* A detailed plan about the research you are planning
* Motivation
* What you are doing
* How you plan to do it
* Rationale on proposed plan
* May need approval to collect the data?

# Phase III: Planning - Step VI
**Collecting data**

* Gather the data with your research tool
	* Survey
	* Eye-tracking
	* Interviews
	* Etc.

* Are there ethical issue
	* Data privacy?

# Phase III: Planning - Step VII
**Processing and displaying data**

* Making sense of the data
* How you analyze data is related to how you present findings
* How you communicate results has a big affect
* Qualitative
	* Narrative
	* Content analysis
	* Etc.
* Quantitative
	* Descriptive statistics
	* Charts
	* Inference testing
	* Etc.

# Phase III: Planning - Step VIII
**Write a research report**

* People need to know your awesome work
* What did you do, what conclusions/contributions you make
* General form depends on the area
* Common to frame in terms of the research questions you are investigating and answering
* Fuels additional work

# Guidelines
* These phases/steps are not absolute.  Research may not need all steps or follow the same order.
* Examples:
	* Reuse data collected to answer other research questions
	* Developed a new better tool first, then find problems it can be used to improve upon

# Thinking About the Research Process
* As a class, select a topic to we want to find out about
	* Example: What affect does identifier naming style have on ability to comprehend programs?
* Divide into groups of 3-4 and develop rough research plan of how you go about learning more about that topic
