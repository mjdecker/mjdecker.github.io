# Goals of a Presentation
* Why are you presenting?
	* To communicate some idea, concept, or method to an audiance
* Communication is a two way process
	* Speaker (giver)
	* Audience (receiver)
* Goal: Communicate a message

# Importance of the Skill
* We make presentations for:
	* Thesis and Dissertation defense
	* Conference talks
	* Course lectures
	* Interview talks
	* Presentations to employer
* You will be judged by your ability to communicate
	* If they do not get it - **it is not their fault!**

# Basics
* Know your audience
* Prepare well
* Define your message

# The Audience
* Listening is difficult
* Your job is to make it easier by continually asking yourself if they get it
* As such
	* Give audience time to think
	* Do **NOT** talk nonstop
	* They do not know the material as well as you
	* Figures and equations need time to digest
	* New terminology and definitions need to be repeated
	* Remind audience of key facts, definitions, etc.

# Know the Audience
* Expert, knowledgeable, novice, student, general public?
* A talk to peers is different than to more general audience
* Find out who will be the audience
* Do not under estimate the audience
* Audience may have very preconceived notions about the topic (or terminology)

# Engage the Audience
* Ask real and rhetorical questions to keep people's minds active and engaged
	* This is a clue to their understanding
	* What if they do not respond
* Make eye contact
* Walk towards a person who asks, or response, to a question
	* Look at them directly
* Try to make examples interesting and compelling (but while keeping simple enough)


# Verbal Presentation
* Speak clearly
* Slowly and loud enough to be heard
	* Especially for non-native speakers
* Speak to audience and **NOT** to the screen, white board, or computer!!
* Walk over, emphasize, and point

# Slides
* Do **NOT** over do PowerPoint/Keynote
* Slides should be simple without distractions
* What you and the slide say should be different
* Moderate use of color and animation
* High contrast between lettering and back
* Appropriate <span style="font-size: 8pt">font size</span>
* Each slide should be:
	* Relatively terse
	* Highlight key points
	* Have a meaningful (and unique) title - not Introduction(5)

# Message
* What do you want to communicate?
	* Use a top-down approach
	* Give big picture first - the what and why
	* Then go into details

# General Organization
1. Tell them what you are going to tell them
2. Tell them
3. Tell them what you told them

* Summarize at beginning and end
* Use this technique for each major section of the presentation

# Emphasize the Important
* Often times, much of the material presented is well known or obvious
* New/important material can get lost
* Clearly highlight import parts by:
	* Physical: Tone of voice, body language
	* Visual: Good slides
	* Verbal: Tell them
	* Mental: Relate it to what they already know

# Repetition
* Repeat the important parts
	* 20% or more audience are thinking about something else at any give time
	* They have not thought about and are not as familiar as you are
* Emphasize the main message repeatedly
* Remind audience about new terms
* Listening is difficult

# Know Your Material
* There may be someone who knows the material as well (or better) as you in audience
* Do not include slides/material you can't explain
* Be honest if you do not know the answer
* Anticipate questions (give them leads)

# Practice
* Practice
* Practice
* Practice
* In the mirror
* To friends, roommate, parent/sibling, advisor, fellow students

# General Outline
