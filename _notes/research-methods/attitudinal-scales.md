# Attitudinal Scales
* Scale to measure peoples attitudes towards some condition, problem, phenomenon, etc.
* Examples:
	* Level of satisfaction
	* positive/negative
* Provide techniques to combine attitude toward different aspects into overall indicator
* Quantitative - Explores types of attitudes, how many have a certain attitude, intensity of attitude, comparison of attitudes on two treatments
* Qualitative - Explores spread of attitudes and establishes types of attitudes

# Developing Attitudinal Scales
1. Which aspects of a situation should be included when seeking to measure an attitude toward an issue or problem?
2. What procedure should be adopted for combining the different aspects to obtain an overall picture?
3. How can one ensure that a scale really is measuring what it is supposed to measure?

# Types of Attitudinal Sales
* Likert Scale - summated rating scale
* Thurstone Scale - equal-appearing interval scale or differential scale
* Guttman scale - cumulative scale

# Likert Scale
* Ordinal Scale
* Most common attitudinal scale
* Measures intensity of attitude towards some issue/aspect
* Each statement has equal attitudinal value

# Likert Scale (continued)
* Measures in categories or on a numerical scale
* Measures on 1 - 3 dimensions (e.g., positive/negative/neutral)
* Scores can be assigned to attitude scale (provides ordering)
* 5 and 7 points are common
* Examples?

# [Thurstone Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurstone_scale)
* Interval Scale
* Consists of a series of statements each with a numerical value of favorable or unfavorable
* People check statements they agree with and mean score computed to indicate attitude
* Reflects absolute rather than relative attitudes

# Guttman Scale
* Ratio Scale
* Cumulative scale which is rarely used
* Series of questions laid out such that if respondent agrees to a questions, they will also agree wth all previous 
* [Example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guttman_scale)

# In-class
* Class picks a topic of study
* Split into groups of 4-5
* Each group develop 3 Likert scale questions on selected topic
* We will discuss, answer, and analyze each as a class
* Example: Rate each of the following based on how easy each identifier style is to read

|Style|Extremely unreadable|Unreadable|Neither Readable or Unreadable|Readable|Extremely readable|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|under_score| | | | | |
|camelCase| | | | | |
|Hungarian| | | | | |
