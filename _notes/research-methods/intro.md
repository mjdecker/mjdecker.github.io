# What is Research?

# Research
> * The systematic investigation into and study of materials and sources in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions.  [Oxford]

> * A structured inquiry that utilizes acceptable scientific methodology to solve problems and creates new knowledge that is generally applicable.  [Grinnell 1993]

# Is this a Research Definition?
> * The application of scientific and mathematical principles to practical ends such as the design, manufacture, and operation of efficient and economical structures, machines, processes, and systems. [thefreedictionary]

# Engineering
> * The application of scientific and mathematical principles to practical ends such as the design, manufacture, and operation of efficient and economical structures, machines, processes, and systems. [thefreedictionary]

# Science or Research?
> * A paper presents a new method for reverse-engineering UML class diagrams.  Approach is evaluated on C++ code.

# Science or Research?
> * A paper reverse-engineers UML class diagrams for Object-oriented Fortran.

# Research in Computer Science
* Relatively new and less mature field
* Diverse - encompasses a large number of sub-disciplines
* Interdisciplinary 
	* Borrows research methodology from other disciplines
	* Cooperates with other disciplines
	* Solutions inspired by other disciplines 
* Rapidly paced
	* Conference vs Journals 

# Diverse
*  Algorithms
* Data Science
* Machine Learning/Data Mining
* Security & Privacy
* Software Engineering 
* Etc.

# Interdisciplinary
* Biology (e.g., bioinformatics & turtle shell recognition)
* Psychology (e.g., program comprehension & HCI)
* Mathematics and Statistics (e.g., algorithms & data science)
* Physics (e.g., quantum computing)
* Etc.

# Why do we do Research (generally)?

# Why do we do Research (generally)?
* To understand the environment/field of interest
* To explain phenomenon
* To provoke positive change
* To improve/automate various things (life, processes, etc.)
* To contribute to a community/society
* It's fun

# Research Characteristics
* Controlled
* Rigorous
* Systematic
* Valid and verifiable
* Empirical
* Critical

# Controlled
* An outcome may be the result of a variety of different influences (variables)
* To ascertain the impact of one variable, the others need to be controlled (minimized, measured, varied)
* Various factors (e.g., subjects) influence the variables and ability/difficulty in controlling
	* Algorithm efficiency vs. human study

# Rigorous & Systematic
* Rigorous - your procedures are appropriate and justifiable to answer your research question(s)
* Systematic - Steps taken as part of the procedure are followed in a logical order

# Valid and Verifiable
* The conclusions drawn are valid based on the findings of your research
* Your results can be verified by others

# Empirical & Critical
* Empirical - Conclusions are based from real-life evidence
	* > based on, concerned with, or verifiable by observation or experience rather than theory or pure logic [Google]
	* Not all research is empirical
* Critical - process and procedures must be correct and be able to withstand critical scrutiny

# Reproducibility
* Research needs to be reproducibly by others
* Allows work to be verified by others
* Research is subject to the resources available
* Reproducibility allows others can replicate study and validate the generalizability of approach
* [The ROSE Festival](https://2018.fseconference.org/track/rosefest-2018)

# Contribution
* Research contributes something new to existing knowledge of the field
* Can be positive result, negative result, replication, etc.

# Categorizing Research
* Can categorize along the following perspectives:
	* Application
	* Objective
	* Mode of Enquiry

# Application Perspective
* Based on the application of the results
* Pure research
	*  > developing and testing theories and hypotheses that are intellectually challenging to the researcher but may or may not have practical application at the present time or in the future [Bailey 1978]
	* Refinement/improvement/development of research methodology
* Applied research - applied research methodology to collect/describe/understand some aspect/situation/phenomenon

# Objective Perspective
* Based on the goal (objective) of the study
* Descriptive - seeks to describe something systematically (e.g., teaching evaluations)
* Correlational - seeks to establish/describe a relationship between a described phenomenon (e.g., impact caffeine has on programming ability)
* Explanatory - seeks to explain how and why there is a relationship (e.g., why programming in Java makes people angry)
* Exploratory - seeks to investigate an area for which little is known, an intended first pass to develop an improved research design, or determine feasibility
* Possible to have research with multiple objectives

# Mode of Enquiry Perspective
* Based on flexibility available during research process
* Qualitative
* Quantitative
* Mixed methods

# Quantitative
* >Human beings achieve knowledge because of their capacity to reason [Bernard 1994]
* Structured - set of procedures is predetermined
* Purpose: describe extent (quantify)
* Samples Size: Generally large
* Data: Numerical and can be analyzed via statistical means
* Generalizable
* Example: Determine what percentage of a developer time is spent comprehending code

# Qualitative
* >The only knowledge that human beings acquire is from sensory experiences [Bernard 1994]
* Unstructured  - flexible/open methodology
* Purpose: describe variation
* Samples Size:  Smaller
* Data: Narratives that are analyzed for themes
* More detailed information and flexibility in answers received
* Example: Understand how developers go about comprehending code

# Mixed Methods
* Certain situations are better suited for either qualitative and/or quantitative approaches
* Choose the best methods (qualitative and/or quantitative) to answer research questions
* Mixed when more than 1 (qualitative and/or quantitative) is used during process
* Additional, methods can act as a a check on upon the other

# Tell Us About Yourself
* What area's of computer science do you have knowledge and/or interest in?
* What experience, if any, do you have doing research?
* Something else unique about yourself?

#  Examples of Quantitative and Qualitative Research
* Split into groups, and brainstorm a qualitative and quantitative research in some area of computer science.
