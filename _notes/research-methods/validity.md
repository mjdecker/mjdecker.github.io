# Validity
* Ability of a research instrument to measure what it is supposed to measure
* Several Types
	* Face/Content
	* Concurrent/Predictive
	* Construct Validity
	* Internal/External

# Validity Types
* Construct validity - Extent instrument to measure what it is supposed to
* Face Validity - Logic link between research instrument and research objective
* Content Validity - All aspects of the issue are being measured
* Concurrent Validity - How well instrument compares with a second assessment done concurrently
* Predictive validity - Degree to which an instrument can forecast an outcome
* [Conclusion Validity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_conclusion_validity) - Extent to which conclusions about the relationship between variables (as derived from data) are correct 

# Internal and External Validity
* [Internal Validity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_validity) - Extent to which a piece of evidence supports a claim about cause and effect, within the context of a particular study
	* Determined by how well alternative explanations can be ruled out
* [External Validity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_validity) - Extent to which the results of a study can be generalized
	* Dependent on internal validity
* It is common for threats to validity to be described in these (and some of the other types)

# Reliability
* Extent to which repeated measures are consistent
* Human factors affecting reliability
	* Question wording - ambiguities may be interpret differently at different times
	* Physical setting
	* Respondent's/interviewer's mood
	* Nature of interaction - in interview the interaction between respondent and interviewer produce different results
	* Regression effect - after reflecting on it, a respondent may answer differently

# Determining External Consistency
* Test and retest with same instrument
* Use two different instruments in parallel

# Determining Internal Consistency
* Repeated measures (e.g., questions measuring same thing) should give similar results
* Split-half technique - Split in half such that any two statements measuring same thing appear in different halves.  Correlate results

# K-Fold Cross Validation
* Commonly applied to machine learning, etc.
* Partition data randomly into k equal parts
	* K - 1 used for training model
	* 1 used for testing model
* Repeat K times such that each part is used to test model (validate)
* Can then average K results to produce a single estimation
* 5 & 10 are common K

# Qualitative Validity & Reliability
* Credibility (internal validity) - believability and trustworthiness of findings
* Transferability (external validity) - Degree finding can be transferred into other contexts (i.e., generalizability)
* Dependability (reliability) - degree repeated results will result in similar findings
* Confirmability (objectivity) - how well findings are supported via data (when examined by other researchers) 

# Example Threats to Validity
* [Eye-tracking](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10664-012-9201-4.pdf)

# In-class
* What threats to validity can occur if you were to ask 100 peers to measure their body weight and height for use in calculating body mass index (BMI).  Formula is:

	```
	BMI = mass(kg) / height(m)^2
	```
