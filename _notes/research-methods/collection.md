# Data Collection
* Process of collecting data to answer research questions and hypothesis
* What data do you need to collect to answer your question?
* Are there limitations, biases, threats?

# Method Differences 
* Same methods may be applied for both qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods
* Classification as qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods depends on
	* Philosophical approach to enquiry
	* How it was collected: formal vs informal or both
	* When were the questions or issues of data collection discussed: prior to collection vs during collection

# Method Differences (continued)
* Classification also depends on  
	* How information is recorded
		* Description, narrative, categorical, quantitative form, on a scale
	* Analysis method: descriptive, categorical, or numerical analysis
	* How findings will be communicated: descriptive or analytical
	* How many methods are used in study

# Data Sources
* Primary - research undertakes data collection
* Secondary - Data is already available and can be reanalyzed
	* Suffers from problems with: validity/reliability, personal bias, availability, and format

# Observation
* One of many ways to collect data
* Two types
	* Participant observation - researcher participates in activities of group observed (with or without others knowledge)
	* Non-participant observation - researcher does not participate in activities, a passive observer

# Observation Conditions
* Observations can be made under two conditions
	* Natural - Observe without interfering with natural/normal conditions
	* Controlled - Introducing of a stimulus and observe reactions

# Recording Observation
* Narrative recording
* Scale recording
* Categorical recording
* Electronic device recording

# Narrative Recording
* Researcher records a description in their own words
* Qualitative
* Typically, brief notes are made during observation and full description written afterwards
* Advantage
	* Deeper insight into object of study
* Disadvantage
	* Prone to bias, affecting interpretations and conclusions

# Scale Recording
* Researcher may develop a scale to rate various aspects
* Advantage
	* Allows for greater focus for observation
* Disadvantages
	* Data is not in-depth

# Categorical Recording
* Records observations along categories
* Similar to scaling
* Example Category
	* Always/sometimes/never
* Similar advantages/disadvantages to scale recording

# Electronic device recording
* Observations made via an electronic device
	* E.g., video camera, eye-tracker, EEG (electroencephalogram)
* Advantage
	* Allows for more objectivity from repeating observations by self and others
* Disadvantage
	* People may behave differently

# Effects affecting Observation
* Hawthorne effect - Participants aware of observation and change behavior
* Elevation effect - Researcher over-uses a particular part of scale for recording
	* E.g., teacher sticks to high or low grades
* Halo effect - Research bias towards a particular participants
	* E.g., Participant performance on one aspect affects another
* Central Tendency Error - Research/Respondents have tendency (when have low confidence) to rate near center of scales

# Sample Collection Techniques
* Interview
* Questionnaire

# Interview
* Verbal exchange (often face-to-face) where interviewer elicits information
* Unstructured interview
* Structured interviews

# Unstructured Interview
* Characterized by freedom in structure, content, wording, and question order
* Advantage
	* Allows flexibility to adjust and delve deeper into areas
	* Provides greater variety/diversity
* Disadvantage
	* Difficult to do
	* Need to be careful not to follow into pitfalls with question asking

# Structured Interview
* Ask predetermined set of questions with same wording and same order
* Advantages
	* Provides uniform and comparable data
	* Questions can be pre scrutinized
	* Requires less skill to administer
* Disadvantage
	* Flexibility

# Questionnaire
* Written list of questions completed by respondent
* Types (not mutually exclusive)
	* Mail or postal questionnaire
	* Collective administration - involves a captive audience (such as students in a class)
	* Online questionnaire
	* Administration in a public place (done collectively)

# Considerations between Interview & Questionnaire
* Nature of investigation - E.g., asking sensitive information 
* Geographical distribution - closely or widespread
* Type of study population - age, literacy, etc.

# Questionnaire Strengths
* Convenience
* Time saving
* Inexpensive: human & financial resources
* Greater anonymity
	* No face-face interaction
	* Increased likelihood to obtain accurate information on sensitive questions

# Questionnaire Weaknesses
* Limited application - study population that  can read/write, not too young/old, and not handicapped in certain ways
* Low response rate
* Self-selection bias
* Can't clarify responses
* No spontaneous responses
* Responses to questions may affect other responses
* No control over environment respondent took questionnaire
	* E.g., were others involved?
* Can't supplement with additional info

# Interview Strengths
* Easier to address complex situations
* Allows for more in-depth collection of data
* Can supplement information
* Questions can be explained
* Wider application

# Interview Weaknesses
* Time consuming
* Expensive
* Quality depends on
	* Interaction quality
	* Interviewer quality
* Variance between separate interviewers
* Possible research bias

# Question Types
* Open-ended - Categories not provided 
* Closed - Possible answers are set out

# Open-ended Questions
* Strengths
	* Provide in-depth information
	* Greater variety
	* No investigator bias
* Weaknesses
	* Analysis is more difficult
	* Need to classify answers
	* Loss of information if respondent can't express themselves
	* Possible interviewer bias
	* If optional (on a survey), respondence likely to skip 

# Closed Questions
* Strengths
	* Usually easier to answer 
	* Easy to analyze
* Weaknesses
	* Lack of depth to information
	* Greater chance of investigator bias
	* Answers selected may not reflect true opinion
		* E.g., due to limited choices

# Formulating Questions
* Use easy and everyday language
	* May need to define terms
* Avoid
	* Ambiguous questions
	* Double-barreled questions
	* Leading questions
	* Questions based on assumptions

# Ambiguous Questions
* AKA Broad questions
* Lacks focus and/or include items that are not clearly defined or those that can be interpreted in multiple way
* Ambiguous
	* Describe the way you use your tablet 
	* Rate the readability of code sample X
* Better
	* Which apps did you use on your tablet computer over the last week?
	* Define readability first.

# Double-barreled Questions
*  Asks about multiple items while only allowing for a single response, 
* Results in less reliable and valid data
* Double-barreled
	* How satisfied or dissatisfied are you with your smartphone and tablet computer?
* Correct - break down into multiple questions
	* How satisfied or dissatisfied are you with your smartphone?
	* How satisfied or dissatisfied are you with your tablet computer?


# Leading Questions
* Manipulates respondents into giving a certain answer by providing biasing content or suggesting information the researcher is looking to have confirmed
* Also, do not tell respondents how example questions should be answered
* Leading
	* This application was recently ranked as number one in customer satisfaction. How satisfied are you with your experience today?
* Acquiescence Bias - When asked a statement and whether they agree/disagree, yes/no, etc. some respondence more likely to choose affirmative


# Questions Based on Assumptions
* Do not assume participants belong to particular group
* Assumption
	* Who is your favorite Star Trek captain: Kirk or Picard?
	* Whos is your favorite actor(ress): Shah Rukh Khan or Priyanka Chopra

# Constructing of Collection Medium
* Personal and sensitive questions
	* Affects data quality
	* Can be asked directly or indirectly
* Question may affect response
	* Logical progression - can be constructed from simple to complex & sustains interest, but may condition respondent
	*  Random order - avoids learning bias, but may frustrate participants or cause dropout

# Pre-testing
* Perform a preliminary study
* Will be errors in instrument pre-testing helps locate biases, and poor question wording

#  Pre-requisites for data collection
* Motivation to share required information
	* Must have respondents consent
* Clear understanding of questions
	* Respondents understand what is expected of them and understand the questions
* Possession of required information
	* Respondents must be qualified to answer questions
	* Respondents must have information you are seeking

# In-class
* In groups, design a short questionnaire (6-8 questions)
* Topic: How developers write code

# In-class (continued)
* Swap question is with another group, and peer assess:
	* Wording of the question
	* Ordering of the questions
	* Question types used
	* Overall layout of the questionnaire
