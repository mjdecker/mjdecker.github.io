# Purpose of Literature Review
* Integral part
* Benefits
	* Helps formalize research question
	* Identifies strengths/weaknesses with current work and how they can be improved upon
	* Identify accepted methodology/research plan or helps improve your own
	* Increases knowledge of area
	* Contextualizes your research in terms of existing work
	* Need for related work section of writeup

# How to Identify a Topic
* Provided for you
* An Idea
* Identified from reading papers/listening to presentations
* Start with broad area of interest and narrow down

# How to review
* Focus is on research problem
	* What is already known on the subject?  Are there any gaps?
	* What questions have been asked? Are they all answered?
	* Are there flaws or limitations with previous work.
	* Is future work mentioned?  Has it been done?
	* Are there new techniques that can be applied to the research?

# Process
1. Search the existing literature
2. Review and summarize the current work
3. Develop a theoretical framework
4. Develop a conceptual framework

# Search the Existing Literature
* Compile a list of keywords to search
	* Initial keywords will not be enough
	* Additional search terms will be identified as you go
* Create a reading list
* Use research databases to find papers
	* Conference
	* Journals
	* Books
	* Etc.

# Finding a Relevant Paper
* Use title and abstract are a good place to start for relevancy
* Intro (near end) and conclusion often highlights the key points of the paper
* Related work section and citations will help find additional work
* Google Scholar functionality identifies who cited the paper and is useful for finding additional work

# Review and Summarize the Current Work
* Examine critically
* What methodology did they use?
* Are there flaws with the methodology or conclusions?
* Do results generalize?
* Are results consistent between papers?
* Are there unanswered questions or future work?
* Where is little known?

# Spotting Good Papers
* Some indicators of good papers (but imperfect):
	* Authors
	* Conference
	* Citation count
* Finding good conferences
	* Ask advisor
	* [CORE](https://www.core.edu.au/conference-portal)
* [SCIgen](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/scigen/#about)
* Reading lots of papers and familiarizing oneself with an area and its methodology is the best way to spot good/bad papers

# Developing Theoretical and Conceptual Framework
* Read with specific purpose in mind
* Identify and order by themes and theories present (theoretical framework)
* Literature ranges from very general to very narrow
* Select aspects from theoretical framework to form conceptual framework

# Writing a Literature Review
* Describe and organize by various theories
* Specify gaps in existing knowledge area	
	* When writing related work, this provides motivation and reason for how your work adds to existing knowledge body
* Highlight recent advances and state-of-the-art, and current trends
* Summarize findings from existing studies

# Writing a Literature Review (continued)
* Cite the work you are discussing and summarizing
* Use appropriate citations style
	* IEEE Cite as you write
	* Author Year
* Paper space is finite.  Most important (related) work must be cited, other work may not need to be (may require justification)

# Process Notes
* Research process order is flexible
* Literature review may be performed later, but
	* Must have enough prior knowledge of subject
	* Otherwise, taking a chance
