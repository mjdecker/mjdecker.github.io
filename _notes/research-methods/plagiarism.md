* Instructions 

* Use your brushed-up understanding of plagiarism to respond to these questions.  You will determine whether the student work attributes the original work correctly or not.

* For each question, use the paragraph provided as the original source, and then determine whether the student work cites the passage properly or whether it represents plagiarism. Consider correct use of quotations, summary, paraphrase, and citation. The answers may surprise you! 

# Source paragraph
* The paragraph is taken from an original source [Trevelyan, G. M. (1963).   England in the Age of Wycliffe, 1368-1520. New York: Harper and Row. (Original work published 1899)] 

> The demand for personal freedom, which had been the chief cause of revolt, was for the moment crushed. The Parliament of November gratefully confirmed the King’s repeal of the liberating charters. A unanimous vote of county and town members together contradicted all rumours that the emancipation of the serfs was seriously considered by Parliament. The Rising had failed. But the process of manumission, which had been going on for so long, continued steadily during succeeding generations. Under the Tudors the last remains of serfage were swept away, and in James the First’s reign it became a legal maxim that every Englishman was free. It must remain a matter of opinion whether this process was accelerated or retarded by the Peasants’ Rising; it is impossible to apply hard facts to the solution of such a problem [Trevelyan 1963].

# Question 1

> Student paper: The events that followed the Peasant’s Rising crushed the chief cause of the revolt: the demand for personal freedom  [Trevelyan 1963].

# Question 2

> Student paper: Trevelyan found it difficult to determine the effect that the Peasant’s Rising had on the development of freedom in England  [Trevelyan 1963].

# Question 3
> Student paper: Although freedom did not come all at once for England’s serfs, George Trevelyan claims in England in the Age of Wycliffe, 1368–1520, that manumission “continued steadily during succeeding generations.”

# Question 4
> Student paper:  According to George Trevelyan (1899/1963), a vote confirming the King’s repeal of the liberating charters “contradicted all rumours that the emancipation of the serfs was seriously considered by Parliament” [Trevelyan 1963].

# Question 5
> Student paper:  The idea that all Englishmen were born free did not become a common belief until the reign of James the First [Trevelyan 1963].

# Question 6
> Student paper:  Although the actions of the King and Parliament after the Peasant’s Rising denied freedom to England’s serfs, serfdom nevertheless continued to erode. By the reign of the Tudors, it had disappeared completely, and by the time of James the First, all Englishmen considered themselves free. The role played by the Peasant’s Rising in this transition remains unclear.

# Question 7
> Student paper:  The King of England reneged on his promises to the peasants, and in November 1381, Parliament confirmed the King’s actions.

# Question 8
> Student paper:  "The Rising had failed" [Trevelyan 1963], but a chain of events had begun that ultimately resulted in freedom for the peasants.

# Question 9
> Student paper: The Peasant's Rising was a response to a one-shilling poll tax imposed by parliament.

# Question 10
> Student paper: Demands for individual freedom, the primary reason for revolt, were smashed after the November Parliament agreed with the King that the Rising had failed [Trevelyan 1963].
