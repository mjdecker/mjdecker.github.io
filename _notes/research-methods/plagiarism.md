# Source paragraph
> The demand for personal freedom, which had been the chief cause of revolt, was for the moment crushed. The Parliament of November gratefully confirmed the King’s repeal of the liberating charters. A unanimous vote of county and town members together contradicted all rumours that the emancipation of the serfs was seriously considered by Parliament. The Rising had failed. But the process of manumission, which had been going on for so long, continued steadily during succeeding generations. Under the Tudors the last remains of serfage were swept away, and in James the First’s reign it became a legal maxim that every Englishman was free. It must remain a matter of opinion whether this process was accelerated or retarded by the Peasants’ Rising; it is impossible to apply hard facts to the solution of such a problem [Trevelyan 1963].

# Question 1

> The events that followed the Peasant’s Rising crushed the chief cause of the revolt: the demand for personal freedom  [Trevelyan 1963].

# Question 2

> Trevelyan found it difficult to determine the effect that the Peasant’s Rising had on the development of freedom in England  [Trevelyan 1963].

# Question 3
> Although freedom did not come all at once for England’s serfs, George Trevelyan claims in England in the Age of Wycliffe, 1368–1520, that manumission “continued steadily during succeeding generations.”

# Question 4
>  According to George Trevelyan (1899/1963), a vote confirming the King’s repeal of the liberating charters “contradicted all rumours that the emancipation of the serfs was seriously considered by Parliament” [Trevelyan 1963].

# Question 5
> The idea that all Englishmen were born free did not become a common belief until the reign of James the First [Trevelyan 1963].

# Question 6
> Although the actions of the King and Parliament after the Peasant’s Rising denied freedom to England’s serfs, serfdom nevertheless continued to erode. By the reign of the Tudors, it had disappeared completely, and by the time of James the First, all Englishmen considered themselves free. The role played by the Peasant’s Rising in this transition remains unclear.

# Question 7
> The King of England reneged on his promises to the peasants, and in November 1381, Parliament confirmed the King’s actions.

# Question 8
> "The Rising had failed" [Trevelyan 1963], but a chain of events had begun that ultimately resulted in freedom for the peasants.

# Question 9
> The Peasant's Rising was a response to a one-shilling poll tax imposed by parliament.

# Question 10
> Demands for individual freedom, the primary reason for revolt, were smashed after the November Parliament agreed with the King that the Rising had failed [Trevelyan 1963].
