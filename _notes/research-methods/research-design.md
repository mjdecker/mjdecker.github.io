# Research Design
* A detailed plan of how research will be completed
	* Variables
	* Sample selection
	* Data collection methods
	* Analysis Methods
* Valid & reliable
* Justified
* Supported by existing literature

# Function of Research Design
* Conceptualize and plan the various procedures and tasks required to complete the study
* Ensure procedures are adequate to obtain valid, objective, and accurate answers to research questions 
	* Control of Variance [Kerlinger 1986]

# Research Design: Details
* Specify procedures and details clearly
* Enough detail that another research can repeat the design exactly and get the same results
	* [ROSE Festival](https://2018.fseconference.org/track/rosefest-2018)
* Include 
	* Name/details of the study design
	* Study population
	* Analysis methods
	* Ethical issues


# Theory of Causality
* Difficult to show
* Considerations:
	* Impact on the independent variable
	* Cause of change on dependant variable
	* Other affecting (extraneous) variables typically via control group to quantify impact
	* Random or change variables (change in dependent) due to e.g., mood of respondents, ambiguity of research instrument

# Change in Dependent Variable

```
Change in dependent variable =
	    change attributed to independent variable
	+/- change attributed to extraneous variables
	+/- change attributable to chance and random variables
````

# Controlling for Extraneous Variables
* Ensure have similar impact on control and experiment groups
	* Randomization
	* Matching 
* Eliminate or isolate extraneous variable
	* Build extraneous variable into design (study separately and along with independent)
	* Eliminate the variable (e.g., hold variable constant)

# Take Homes
* State design/procedure of study in detail
* Minimize the change that extraneous/change variables can cause on dependent variable
* Maximize opportunity independent variable has to affect dependent variable

# In-class
* Research Task:  A researcher has developed a new method and language for querying source code.  Researcher wants to show that the approach performs better than the state-of-the-art approach
* What are the dependent, independent, and extraneous variables?
* How might we go about:
	* Sampling
	* Data collection
	* Analysis
	* Ethical considerations

# In-class (continued)
* Selecting one approach from before, how might we
	* Maximize opportunity independent variable has to affect dependent variable
	* Minimize error variance and affect of extraneous variables
