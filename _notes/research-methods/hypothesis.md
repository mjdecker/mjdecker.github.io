# Hypothesis
> An educated guess [Decker]

* Hypothesis -> Verify -> Repeat
* Hypothesis is an assertion that becomes the basis for which enquiry is made
* Brings focus in quantitative research

* Grinnell's Definition
	* A tentative proposition that can be proven or disproven
	* Validity is unknown, hence reliable and valid data needed
	* Specified a relationship between variables

# Functions of Hypothesis
* Formulating a Hypothesis give clarity and focus to study
	* Data required
	* Measurements
	* Objectivity
* Hypothesis testing results in conclusions that add to the existing body of knowledge

# Hypothesis Testing Process
* Phase 1: Formulate a hypothesis based on your hunch or assumption
	* Based on current knowledge/insight
* Phase 2: Collect data relevant to hypothesis
* Phase 3: Use data to draw conclusions about hunch/assumption (true/false)
	* Answers may not be binary, may have indications toward true/false
	* Conflicting answers from separate methods
* Phase 4: Repeat.  The more you learn, the more questions that arise

# Formulating a Hypothesis
* Simple, specific, clear
* Larger questions can be broken down and supported by multiple hypothesis
* Capable of verification and measurable
* Related to existing body of knowledge
	* But, don't be afraid to challenge common knowledge 
* Example: The readability score of srcDiff is greater than GNU diff on the study examples

# Null Hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>)
* Specifies that there is no difference between two groups, situations, outcomes, prevalence of a condition or phenomenon
* H<sub>0</sub>: There is no difference in the readability score between srcDiff and GNU diff

# Alternate Hypothesis (H<sub>a</sub>)
* Accepted once Null hypothesis is not supported
* Specifies that there is is a difference between two groups, situations, outcomes, prevalence of a condition or phenomenon
* H<sub>a</sub>: There is a difference in the readability score between srcDiff and GNU diff
* Can also specify a direction such as greater/less than
* H<sub>a</sub>: The readability score of srcDiff is greater than that of GNU diff

# Errors in Testing Hypothesis
* Incorrect conclusions about hypothesis can be drawn for a variety of reasons
	* Faulty study design
	* Faulty sampling
	* Inaccurate data collection
	* Incorrect analysis/statistical procedures
	* Incorrect or unsupported conclusions

# Type 1 & Type 2 Error
* Hypothesis: True or False
* Decision: Accept or Reject

||True|False|
|---|---|---|
|Accept| Correct decision| Type II error|
|Reject|  Type I error|Correct decision|

# Research Question vs Hypothesis
* Research questions generally broader, more encompassing
* Research question can be broken down and focused as hypotheses

# Formulation Activity
* List variables from last in-class and we will write them on the board
* In groups of 3-4, formulate hypothesis (Null and Alternate)

# Formulation Activity (continued)
* Justify your hypothesis
* Are you able to predict an outcome for all types of hypotheses?
* What information is needed?
