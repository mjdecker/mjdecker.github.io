# Requirements Engineering (RE)
> Process of discovering a software system's purpose, by identifying stakeholders and their needs, and documenting these in a form that is amenable to analysis, communication, and subsequent implementation [Nuseibeh '00]
* Software is judged as successful if it meets its purpose

# RE Process

# RE Process
* Requirements Elicitation
* Requirements Specification
* Requirements Validation

# Elicitation Techniques
* Traditional
* Group Elicitation
* Cognitive
* Contextual
* Prototyping

# Traditional Techniques
> Generic data-gathering techniques

* Survey/questionnaire
* Interviews
* Document Analysis - existing charts, process models/standards, and manuals

# Group Elicitation Techniques
> Foster stakeholder agreement and buy-in, while exploiting team dynamics to elicit richer understanding of needs

* Brainstorming
* Focus Group
* Workshops

# Cognitive Techniques
> Knowledge acquisition techniques

* Protocol analysis/Think-aloud
* Laddering
* Card Sorting
* Repertory Grids

# Contextual Techniques
* Participant Observation
* Ethnography
* Ethnomethodology
* Conversation Analysis

# Prototyping
* Throwaway
* Evolutionary
