# Requirements Engineering (RE)
> Process of discovering a software system's purpose, by identifying stakeholders and their needs, and documenting these in a form that is amenable to analysis, communication, and subsequent implementation [Nuseibeh '00]
* Software is judged as successful if it meets its purpose

# RE Process
![][re-process]

# Elicitation Techniques \[Nuseibeh '00]
* Traditional
* Group Elicitation
* Cognitive
* Contextual
* Prototyping

# Traditional Techniques
> Generic data-gathering techniques

* Survey/questionnaire - Written list of questions completed by the respondent
* Interviews - Verbal exchange (often face-to-face) where interviewer elicits information
* Document Analysis - Existing charts, process models/standards, and manuals

# Group Elicitation Techniques
> Foster stakeholder agreement and buy-in, while exploiting team dynamics to elicit a richer understanding of needs

* Brainstorming  - Group discussion to produce spontaneous ideas
* Focus Group - Group interview of similar people
* Workshop - Organized group discussion(s) on specific topic(s)

# Cognitive Techniques
> Knowledge acquisition techniques

* Protocol analysis/Think-aloud - participant thinks aloud while peformaing a task
* [Laddering] - Continuous probe to elicit structure and content of stakeholder knowledge
* Card Sorting - Stakeholders sort cards in groups of which each has the name of a domain entity
* Repertory Grids -  Highly structured interview tool where responses are set out in a grid

# Contextual Techniques
* Ethnography - Participant observation, where the investigator involves themselves with a group of interest
* [Ethnomethodology] - Study of how social order is produced in and through processes of social interaction
* [Coversational Analysis] - Study of social interaction through both verbal and non-verbal conduct

# Prototyping
* Throwaway
* Evolutionary
