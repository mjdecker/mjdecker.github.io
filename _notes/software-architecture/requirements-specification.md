# Requirements Engineering (RE)
> Process of discovering a software system's purpose, by identifying stakeholders and their needs, and documenting these in a form that is amenable to analysis, communication, and subsequent implementation [Nuseibeh '00]
* Software is judged as successful if it meets its purpose

# RE Process
![][re-process]

# Functional vs Non-Functional Requirements
* Functional Requirements - Describe the system's functions , its inputs and outputs, exceptions, etc., in detail (i.e., what a system should do)
* Non-functional Requirements - Describe an overall characteristic of the system

# Non-functional Requirement Types
![][non-functional]

# Product vs Organizational vs External
* Product Requirements - Constraints on the behavior of the software, e.g., performance
* Organizational Requirements - Broad system requirements derived from the developer's and customer's organization's policies and procedures, e.g., programming language
* External Requirements - All requirements derived from external factors, e.g., legal requirements
