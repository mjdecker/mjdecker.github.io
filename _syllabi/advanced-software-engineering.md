### Course Description: ###
A seminar style course covering advanced topics related to the analysis, design, development, maintenance, and evolution of large software projects through the critical examination of seminal and recent research in the field of software engineering. Approved for distance learning.

### Course Objectives: ###
The objectives of the course are for students to read, synthesize, and understand advanced topics in core areas of software engineering through a critical examination of seminal and recent research in software engineering. Students will additionally develop presentation skills and research projects based on current literature.

### Learning Objectives: ###
1. I can explain basic and advanced topics in software engineering.
2. I can critically evaluate research papers in software engineering.
3. I can develop a research topic in software engineering based on known literature.
4. I can effectively present and defend a research proposal orally.

### Textbook(s)/Readings: ###
* Readings will primarily consist of conference and journal articles (internet links provided, do not purchase).
* No textbooks is required.

### Course Delivery/Organization Overview: ###
* Course will be run seminar style. 
* Students are required to thoroughly read papers before each class.
* Each paper will be presented by a student with the goal of facilitating discussion.
* Each class, all students are required to participate in discussions. A participation score will be assigned each class period.
* Students will participate in a scholarly review of research papers (including discussion in Canvas) a couple times throughout the semester.
* A term project will be completed and presented (students may work individually or as part of a group).
* A final exam will be held over the material covered in class.

### Course Delivery/Organization Overview: ###
* The course will primarily be run through Canvas. This includes posting of course material such as readings/assignments/exams, assignment submission, and use of discussion boards.
* Discord will be the primary means of communication with the instructor and fellow students (message, voice, and video).
* Announcements will be made via Discord.
* Virtual office hours (above) will be held by the instructor using Discord.

### Course Prerequisites ###
* Software engineering background
* Strong programming skills

---

### Course Assessment: ###
* 30%	Discussion Participation
* 20%	Paper Presentations
* 5%    Scholarly Reviews
* 35%	Term Project and Presentation
* 10%	Final Exam (May 14, 18:00-20:30)

#### Grading Scale (cutoffs): ####
| A | B | C | D | F |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|90%|80%|70%|60%|0%|

#### Discussion Participation ####
Discussion participation is required and is an integral part of the course. Students are required to read the papers thourougly before the class they are presented. Participation will require students to ask/make informed and intelligent questions/comments about each paper or provide informed and intelligent answers to previously asked questions.

A discussion participation grade will be assigned for each paper (on a scale of 1 to 3). 

* One point for attendance (33%),
* Another point for asking/making a new relevant question/comment (66%), and
* Another point for asking/making a new intelligent well-informed question/statement or providing a new intelligent well-informed answer (100%). 

Asking the same questions, making the same comment, or providing the same answer will not receive any points.  However, students may ask (and are encouraged) to ask/make related questions/comments or provide alternate answers that facilitate continued discussion.

Note, participation is mandatory. Thus, to earn a passing grade in discussion participation the student must ask/answer a question(s) or make a comment(s) that clearly demonstrates to the instructor that he/she has thoroughly read each paper.

#### Paper Presentations ####
Paper presentations will be 20 minutes and graded on content and style. Presentations must be the student's own work and provide a means to facilitate discussion. Students will make 2 – 3 paper presentations during the term.  Students who are presenting will receive full credit towards discussion participation for that paper.

#### Scholarly Reviews ####
Periodically, 2-3 times, throughout the semester, students will assigned to review one of the papers for a given week.  A review format will be provided, students are to upload their review in the provided format by Sunday 23:59 the week the papers are assigned.  Between students assigned the same paper, a discussion will be held on the merits/demerits of the paper with a final determination if the paper would be acceptable for publication.  

Discussion will close Saturday at 23:59 the week the papers are assigned.

The instructor will moderate and participate in discussion.

#### Term Project and Presentation ####
The term project will be of an appropriate size for the length of the semester and number of people in the group. Projects can be developed in small groups or by individuals, pending approval by the instructor. Projects must reflect the theme of the course and topics will be developed in conjunction with the instructor. The project can include development of a software prototype, empirical experiments, etc. Projects must be the student’s own work and plagiarism of any type will result in a failing grade for the project. Results of your project work are required to be presented as a 4 page paper ([IEEE proceedings two-column format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html), LaTeX users use the configuration: *\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}* and Microsoft Word users use the US Letter format template). The paper must be structured like the SE research papers read in class. Students will also make a 20 minute presentation on their project and results. The presentation will be the same format as for paper presentations.

#### Final Exam ####
A final exam covering all the papers assigned in class will be held during finals week.

#### Other Notes: ####
* Participation is mandatory and a critical component of the course grade.
* In order that work can be graded and returned promptly and discussions held, late submissions will not be accepted without a valid excuse.
* Make-ups of any work for this class will only be given in the case of an excused absence or a documented, valid emergency. I encourage you to contact me if an emergency arises.
* There will be no make up exams.
* Any modifications to the syllabus will be made on this page and noted.
