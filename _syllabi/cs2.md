#### zyBook Participation & Challenge Activities ####
* It is required that the required reading and activities are finished before the designated class for credit.
* You will be graded on correctness, but you may retry as many times as necessary before due date.

#### Lab Exercises ####
* A typical class will consist of in-class coding exercises.  This may consist of additional readings, coding problems, etc., and they are designed to reinforce and supplement the readings and activities.
* In general, these are designed to be finished during the class period, however, they will be due before the next class period.

#### Projects ####
* A number of projects (about 3–5), both programming and written, will be given to further reinforce the concepts covered in class and link multiple topics. 
* Details on each project and the requirements for that project will be given when assigned.
* Projects will be assigned at the beginning of the week and be given two weeks for completion. Projects are due before the end of the second week.

#### Midterm & Final: ####

* Material will come from readings, exercises, and projects.
* The midterm and final will be in person.

#### Other Notes: ####
* Exercises & Projects
	* Are subject to the following coding standards: [Coding Standards](https://mjdecker.github.io/standards/coding-standards.html)
	* It is the student’s responsibility to make sure all files are in the repository  and thusly, properly submitted by the due date. Files not in the repository/Canvas are not accessible by the instructor and thus are not turned in.
	* Good practices are required (i.e., incrementally developed, committing each increment, and [writing good commit messages](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)).
	* All programs must compile and run correctly as specified.
* In order that work can be graded and returned promptly, late work will not be accepted without a valid excuse. It is up to the student to make up any missed material.
* Make-ups of any work for this class will only be given in the case of a documented, valid emergency. I encourage you to contact me if an emergency arises.
* There will be no make up exams.
