### Course Assessment: ###
* 35%	Discussion Participation
* 20%	Paper Presentations
* 5%    Scholarly Reviews
* 30%	Term Project and Presentation
* 10%	Final Exam

#### Grading Scale (cutoffs): ####

| A | B | C | D | F |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|90%|80%|70%|60%|0%|

#### Discussion Participation ####
Discussion participation is required and is an integral part of the course. Students are required to read the papers thoroughly before the class they are presented. Participation will require students to ask/make informed and intelligent questions/comments about each paper or provide informed and intelligent answers to previously asked questions.

A discussion participation grade will be assigned for each paper (on a scale of 1 to 3). 

* One point for attendance (33%),
* Another point for asking/making a new relevant question/comment (66%), and
* Another point for asking/making a new intelligent well-informed question/statement or providing a new intelligent well-informed answer (100%). 

Asking the same questions, making the same comment, or providing the same answer will not receive any points.  However, students may ask (and are encouraged) to ask/make related questions/comments or provide alternate answers that facilitate continued discussion.

Note, participation is mandatory. Thus, to earn a passing grade in discussion participation, the student must ask/answer a question(s) or make a comment(s) that clearly demonstrates to the instructor that he/she has thoroughly read each paper.

#### Paper Presentations ####
Paper presentations will be 20 minutes and graded on content, style, and technique. Presentations must be the student's own work and provide a means to facilitate discussion. Students will make 2 – 3 paper presentations during the term.  Students who are presenting will receive full credit towards discussion participation for that paper.

#### Scholarly Reviews ####
Periodically, 2-3 times, throughout the semester, students will be assigned to review one of the papers for a given week.  A review format will be provided; students are to upload their review in the provided format by Sunday 23:59, following the week the papers are assigned.  Between students assigned the same paper, a discussion will be held on the merits/demerits of the paper, with a final determination if the paper would be acceptable for publication.  

Discussion will close Saturday at 23:59, the week the reviews are due.

The instructor will moderate and participate in the discussion.

#### Term Project and Presentation ####
The term project will be of an appropriate size for the length of the semester and the number of people in the group. Projects can be developed in small groups or by individuals, pending approval by the instructor. Projects must reflect the theme of the course, and topics will be developed in conjunction with the instructor. The project can include the development of a software prototype, empirical experiments, etc. Projects must be the student’s own work, and plagiarism of any type will result in a failing grade for the project. Results of your project work are required to be presented as a 4-page paper ([IEEE proceedings two-column format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html), LaTeX users use the configuration: *\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}* and Microsoft Word users use the US Letter format template). The paper must be structured like the SE research papers read in class. Students will also make a 20-minute presentation on their project and results. The presentation will be the same format as for paper presentations.

#### Final Exam ####
A final exam covering all the papers assigned in class will be held during finals week.

#### Other Notes: ####
* Participation is mandatory and a critical component of the course grade.
* In order that work can be graded and returned promptly and discussions held, late submissions will not be accepted without a valid excuse.
* Make-ups of any work for this class will only be given in the case of an excused absence or a documented, valid emergency. I encourage you to contact me if an emergency arises.
* There will be no make-up exams.
* Any modifications to the syllabus will be made on this page and noted.
