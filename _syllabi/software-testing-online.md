#### Other Notes: ####
* It is the student’s responsibility to make sure all files are in the repository or Canvas (as required) and thusly, properly submitted by the due date. Files not in the repository/Canvas are not accessible by the instructor and thus are not turned in.
* When a version control system is required to be used for an exercise/project, good practices are required (i.e., incrementally developed, committing each increment, and writing good commit messages Links to an external site.).
* All programs must compile and run correctly as specified with the exercise/project. This may require running on a remote machine.
* In order that work can be graded and returned promptly, late work will not be accepted without a valid excuse. It is up to the student to make up any missed material.
* Make-ups of any work for this class will only be given in the case of a documented, valid emergency. I encourage you to contact me if an emergency arises.
* There will be no make up exams.
* Any modifications to the syllabus will be made on this page and noted.
