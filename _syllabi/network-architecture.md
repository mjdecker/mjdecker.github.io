Refer to the [Veterans] page for additional information.

#### University Closure: ####
In most cases, the University will not close due to inclement weather. This means that for winter conditions, the University will generally remain open unless the Sheriff’s Department from the county in which your campus is located declares a Level 3 emergency. Once the decision is made to delay, cancel or close, individuals will be notified through AlertBG, email, the BGSU homepage, BGSU social media channels and the news media (see the [Emergency Cancellation Delay and Closing Policy and Procedures] document for a list of radio and television stations).

You may review BGSU’s Non-Discrimination in Employment and Education policy for more information. To report concerns, please visit the [See It. Hear It. Report It.] page.

#### Registration and Withdrawal: ####
The official registration and withdrawal deadlines for this course can be found on the university’s [calendar][]. Students who are not officially registered for a course by published deadlines should not be attending classes and will not receive credit or a grade for the course. Each student must confirm enrollment by checking his/her class schedule prior to the deadline indicated. Registration errors must be corrected prior to the deadline.
 
#### Academic Honesty: ####
All coursework for this class is expected to be *YOUR OWN* work.  The *MINIMUM* penalty for copying someone's work or knowingly allowing someone to copy yours is a zero for the assignment/exam/etc. The offense is also reported to the dean of your college.  Plagiarism detection tools may be used in this course.  The Department’s policies and the University's code of academic conduct as defined in the BGSU Student Handbook will be used in this course.  For details refer to:
